# GotCraftProxyChat Configuration
# This configuration file controls cross-server chat behavior

chat:
  # Enable/disable cross-server chat packet forwarding
  enabled: true

  # Server name to identify this server
  # This should match your BungeeCord server name (e.g., "survival", "skyblock", "lobby")
  server-name: "survival"

  # Add server prefix with icon before chat messages
  # Uses MiniMessage formatting - supports colors, gradients, hover, click events
  # Also supports PlaceholderAPI placeholders (if PlaceholderAPI is installed)
  # Set to empty string "" to disable
  # Examples:
  #   "⛏ <gradient:#00ff00:#00aa00>SURVIVAL</gradient>"
  #   "🏝 <color:#00ffff>SKYBLOCK</color>"
  #   "🎮 <color:#ff0000>MINIGAMES</color>"
  #   "<hover:show_text:'Click to teleport!'><click:run_command:/server survival>⛏ SURVIVAL</click></hover>"
  #   "⛏ <gradient:#00ff00:#00aa00>%server_name%</gradient> " (with PlaceholderAPI)
  #   "[%player_world%] " (with PlaceholderAPI)
  server-prefix: "⛏ <gradient:#00ff00:#00aa00>SURVIVAL</gradient> "

# IMPORTANT: This plugin uses ProtocolLib to intercept and forward chat packets
# All chat formatting, colors, hover events, and click events are preserved perfectly
# The server-prefix is prepended to messages from this server when forwarded to other servers
# PlaceholderAPI is supported in server-prefix (optional - works without it if not installed)
# No other message modification is performed - packets are forwarded as-is
